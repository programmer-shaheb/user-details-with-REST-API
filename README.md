# Kawa Space - Frontend Intern Challenge

## [Live Site](https://react-challenge-bb9bb.web.app/).

This is a intern challenge task for kawa space. I wrote all the code using reactjs. To make it responsive site, i used CSS framework Bootstarp. It is easy to use & more maintainable.

This is a single page application. This page is a directory of random people and by clicking on a personâ€™s card, the user
details (at the top of the page) updated with the details of the newly
selected person.

It's a responsive webpage.

## Technology i used:

### React JS

### Bootstrap (css framework)

### axios (for data fetching)

### Firebase (for hosting)
